# Translation tools
Some miscellaneous tools to help with the translation process.

Install dependencies in `requirements.txt` before running these tools.

- `mattegen.py`: Generate a matte from an AtlasReference texture asset bundle.
- `update_atlas.py`: Update a (translated) atlas texture to match a newer atlas by creating a new atlas texture with the sprites remapped to their new location.
